# Leetcode Grind 75 

This repo contains my solutions for a 16-week Grind 75 program, with a 4 hr per week time commitment. View the full list of questions [here](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?hours=4&weeks=16).

Note that there's a lack of language consistency in my solutions. The questions I did in early 2023 are in (very badly written) C++, while more recent ones are in Java and Python.
